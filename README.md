# Mindfulness at the Computer

This application reminds you to take breaks from the computer, helps you
remember to stay in touch with and be mindful of your breathing and body
while sitting at the computer, and helps you concentrate on breathing
in and out when you need a breathing pause.

**The [application website](https://mindfulness-at-the-computer.gitlab.io/)
has more information** (including screenshots and downloads).

The application is written in Python and uses Qt/PyQt for the front-end.

## Motivation when contributing to this project

> *“Don't do anything except with the joy of a small child feeding a hungry duck”*

By feeding the hungry duck, you are helping their well-being and making them happy. You’re not feeding it just because you feel like you *should* or *ought* to, but because it makes both of you happy. That’s how we’d love for you to help with this project! When you contribute, not only are you are helping this project, you are helping others who will use this application, helping them to be mindful whilst working at the computer and to be aware of their breathing and well-being.

## What is Mindfulness?

When we spend many hours in front of our computer screen, focused on solving problems, we may forget that we also have a body. Unnoticed we build up a lot of tension in our body because of bad posture or stress.

With mindfulness, we can become aware of our breathing and our body. This gives us the possibility to notice if there is tension, and then relax our muscles or take a break. Or maybe we are hungry and need to eat something. We may even become aware that we are running around in circles trying to solve a problem. A break may give us a breakthrough.

Mindfulness can also help when we are dealing with negative emotions. When we become aware of them, we can stop, go back to our breathing and relax.

Being mindful means being aware of the present moment in an open and accepting way. What is going on in the here and the now, in the room, in our body, in our mind?
