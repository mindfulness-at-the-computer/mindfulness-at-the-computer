### Behavior at application error

Windows: When an error is encountered the application will crash

Linux-based: The application just prints to stdout

### Notifications

Some systems do not show notifications

Older versions of MacOS seems to be like this for example, then the user will need to install growl

### Systray

Some systems does not have a system tray

### Minimize area

Systems that lack a minimizing area

### 64 and 32 bit Linux-based systems

Application binaries must be built on the same bit-numbered system as where it will run. This may be because of glibc
