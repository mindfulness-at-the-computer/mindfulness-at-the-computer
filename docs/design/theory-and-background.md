## About me

I (Tord / SunyataZero) have a Buddhist background, having practiced Buddhism and meditation for over ten years, and being influenced by the [Plum Village tradition](https://plumvillage.org/) which puts emphasis on mindfulness.


## Background

I, (Tord / SunyataZero) started this project after having worked on a pomodoro application, but then realized that I wanted to focus on mindfulness more than productivity.


## Theory

The application is influenced by Buddhist mindfulness, but the application itself is "secular" and is for everyone to use.

If you are planning to make changes to the features of this application
please read the section "Buddhist Concerns" in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_and_technology).

We need to be aware that there is right mindfulness and wrong mindfulness, right concentration and wrong concentration. Wrong concentration may be that we are so caught-up in our work at the computer.


## Mission statement

This application focuses on mindfulness, resting, and stepping away from the computer (maybe going outside), rather than on getting things done and being effective.

People spending a lot of time in front of the computer can benefit from this application.
