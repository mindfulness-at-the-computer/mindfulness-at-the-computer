## User Requirements

Please note the difference between user reqs and tech reqs

Req | Priority | Status
---|---|---
BREM | Essential | Implemented as breathing dialog popup |
RREM | High | Implemented as rest reminder and rest window |
FOLB | Essential | Implemented in the breathing dialog |
POSI | Medium | *Not covered*, could be covered by using a breathing phrase |
RGBY | Medium | *Not covered*, could be covered by using a rest action or general comment in the rest dialog |
RGPU | Low | *Not covered*, could be covered by using a breathing phrase |



### BREM - Reminders to breathe while using the computer

Showing messages/pop-ups for the user

The user can easily switch between single phrases that are shown to him
(if the user can easily switch between them it's less important to have a list of several)

### RREM - Remembering to take a break

A dialog window can be shown to remind the user to take a break.
This window can maybe also be used to select the new practice (when the user gets back).
(Does this mean that we instead want to show the main window by "restoring" it?)

The application might ask a question like this: "Do you want to take a break?"; "Not right now", "Yes"

A nice alternative to the above is to change the icon in the system tray area when it's time to
take a break, this makes it easier for the user to choose when to take the break

There could also be an audio notification (maybe a bell)

### FOLB - Following the breathing

Using the shift key (or pressing a button with three states) to follow the breath graphically

### POSI - Setting a positive intention

Remembering to be kind to oneself, doing things with "kindfulness"

Perhaps following up with questions later on

Example:
* Was i peaceful in my body and mind?

### RGBY - Remembering to take care of the body

For example by doing some mindful movements

### RGPU - Remembering the purpose of the work at the computer

Maybe we are contributing to social justice, mental well-being or something else, maybe
simply helping our colleagues?
