This application focuses on mindfulness, resting, and getting away from the computer (maybe going outside), rather than on getting things done and being effective

If you are planning to make changes to the features of this application please read the section "Buddhist Concerns" in [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_and_technology)

People spending a lot time in front of the computer can benefit from this application

I (SunyataZero) have a Buddhist background and the application is influenced by Buddhist mindfulness, but the application itself is "secular" and is for everyone to use
